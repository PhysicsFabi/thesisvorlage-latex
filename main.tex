    \chapter{(Theoretical Corrections to the \texorpdfstring{$\upbeta$}{Beta} Decay Spectrum)}
    \section{Motivation}
    What are theoretical corrections?
    
    \section{Application to Data}
    What is the effect on the parameters of interest? How can it be explained? 
    
    
    
    \chapter{Parameter Inference at KATRIN with KaFit}
    
    \section{The KATRIN Likelihood}
    What does parameter inference mean? What does sensitivity on the neutrino mass mean? What is the likelihood? What is a Frequentist approach? What is a Bayesian approach? 
    \section{Overview of Analysis Methods}
    What are the parameters of interest? What is run stacking? What is a uniform fit? Was the neutrino mass fixed? Which energy loss model/fsd binning/...? More general, which analysis configuration was used and why?
    
    \section{Inference Algorithms}
    \subsection{Classical Minimizer}
    What algorithm is implemented in/interfaced to KaFit? What is MINUIT and MINOS? What are the pros and cons?
    \subsection{Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo}
    What is a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo?  What algorithm is implemented in/interfaced to KaFit? What are the pros and cons of the method? What are the pros and cons of the different implementations?
    
    \section{Treatment of Uncertainties}
    \subsection{Nuisance Parameters}
    What are nuisance parameters? How can they be included in an analysis? What are the difficulties? How can these difficulties be circumvented?
    \subsection{Penalized Likelihood and Priors}
    What does it mean to constrain a nuisance parameter? How can penalty terms and priors be described as constraints? How do penalty terms priors compare? How does this fit in a Frequentist and Bayesian framework?
    \subsection{Monte Carlo Propagation and Covariance Matrix Approach}
    What is the Monte Carlo Propagation and the Covariance Matrix Approach. Why are they similar? Where do they differ? What is the motivation behind using them? What are the pros and cons? What is the convergence criteria for the sampling?
    \subsection{Shift Method}
    What is the shift method? What are its limitations and when is it needed?

    \chapter{Studies using the Preliminary KATRIN Energy Loss Model}
    \section{The Preliminary KATRIN Energy Loss Model}
     Which systematic effects were considered? What are the quantified uncertainties on them and where do these numbers come from? Why this selection?
    \section{Neutrino Mass Sensitivity}
    \subsection{Motivation}
    Why combining systematics? What was possible in the scope of this thesis? What does this thesis try to show?
    \subsection{Methodology}
    What is the sensitivity on the parameters of interest? What is the z score and shrinkage for all parameters?
    \subsection{Model Configuration}
    Which model configuration (MTD, Slicing, Eloss-Model, FSD Binning, ...) was chosen and why?
