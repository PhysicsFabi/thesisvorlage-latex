This section presents a quantitative expression for the $\upbeta$-decay rate of a tritium molecule in dependence on the kinetic energy of the emitted $\upbeta$ electron (differential rate). Accordingly, the differential rate is depicted in figure~\ref{fig:intSpecModelDiffSpec} for a vanishing and non-vanishing effective electron-antineutrino mass. The following paragraphs describe the differential rate in a top-down approach. In other words, first the whole expression is denoted, then its components are explained.

Using Fermi theory and Fermi's golden rule the decay rate of a tritium molecule is~\cite{Kleesiek2019} 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:intSpecModelDiffSpec}
\diffRate = &
\frac{\fermiConst^2 \abs{V_\mathrm{ud}}^2}{2 \pi^3}
\abs{\nucMatrixElement}^2 \cdot
F(Z, \Esource) \cdot 
p(\Esource+m_\elecIndex) \cdot 
\sum_{f} 
	P_f \cdot 
	\epsilon_f \cdot 
	\sqrt{\epsilon_f^2-\nuMass^2} \cdot 
	\thetaFunc(\epsilon_f-\nuMass)
	\fullstop
\end{align}
Its constituents are the kinetic electron energy $\Esource$;
the effective electron-antineutrino mass $\nuMass$ defined via the PMNS matrix $U$, equation \eqref{eq:PMNSmatrix},
\begin{equation}
	 \nuMass^2 = \abs{U_{\elecIndex i}}^2 m_i^2\,;
\end{equation}
the Fermi constant $\fermiConst$;
the up-down-quark-coupling given by the Cabibo angle $\theta_\mathrm{C}$~\cite{Kleesiek2019}
\begin{equation}
V_\mathrm{ud} = \cos \theta_\mathrm{C} = 
0.97425\pm0.00022;
\end{equation}
and the nuclear transition matrix element~\cite{Kleesiek2019}
\begin{equation}
\abs{\nucMatrixElement}^2 = g_V^2+3g_A^2 \quad
\text{with } g_v = 1 \quad
\text{and} \quad g_A/g_V = -1.2646 \pm 0.0035
\end{equation}
which is independent of the electron's kinetic energy as the decay is super-allowed and given by the vector $g_V$ and axial vector $g_A$ coupling.

Furthermore, the Fermi function $F(Z,\Esource)$ accounts for the Coulomb interaction between the outgoing electron and the daughter nucleus with atomic charge $Z=2$, which in its relativistic version can be approximated as~\cite{Kleesiek2019}
\begin{equation}
F(Z,\Esource) \approx \frac{2 \pi \eta}{1-\exp{2 \pi \eta}} \cdot R
\comma
\end{equation}
with Sommerfeld parameter $\eta = \alpha Z / \beta$, fine structure constant $\alpha$, relativistic velocity $\beta$ and a relativistic correction factor $R = 1.002037-0.001427\beta$~\cite{Kleesiek2019}.

The phase-space factor of the outgoing electron with momentum $p$ and mass $m_\elecIndex$ is given by the factor $p(\Esource+m_\elecIndex)$.

The phase space factor of the emitted neutrino  depends on multiple quantities: First, there is the $\upbeta$-spectrum endpoint $E_0$. $E_0$ is the total nuclear tritium-decay energy $Q$ corrected for the nucleus recoil $E_\mathrm{rec}$ also called endpoint of the $\upbeta$ spectrum
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:intSpecModelEndpoint}
E_0 = Q-E_\mathrm{rec}
\fullstop
\end{equation}
$Q$ is the mass difference of mother and daughter nucleus and was determined in a Penning trap measurement to be $Q=\SI{18592.01\pm0.007}{eV}$~\cite{Myers2015}. Furthermore, there is the final state energy of the molecular system $V_f$. The exited energy state $f$ is caused by vibration, rotation or electronic excitation of the decaying molecule. A review on tritium molecular final states and tabulated values can e.\,g.~be found in~\cite{Bodine2015} and references therein.  The probability that the molecular system is in a final state of energy $V_f$ after the decay is denoted by $P_f$. Then the energy of the neutrino reads 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_f = E_0 - E - V_f 
\fullstop
\end{equation}
The neutrino's momentum is $\sqrt{\epsilon_f^2-\nuMass^2}$. And the complete phase space factor of the neutrino is a sum over all possible molecular final states labeled $f$.

Lastly, the Heavyside step function $\thetaFunc$ ensures a positive kinetic energy of the neutrino.

\section{Response Function}
The aim of this chapter is the derivation of a formula for the electron rate at the KATRIN detector. Section~\ref{sec:intSpecModelDiffSpec} derived the $\upbeta$-electron rate in dependence of the $\upbeta$-electron energy. The next step is the inclusion of the characteristics of the KATRIN experimental setup. This can be accomplished by denoting the so-called KATRIN response function. It reflects the probability of an $\upbeta$ electron emitted in the \gls{wgts} to reach the KATRIN detector~\cite{Groh2015}.

Within this section the formalism for the KATRIN response function is developed in a bottom-up approach. First, central concepts and the nomenclature are presented in section~\ref{sec:intSpecModelResponseConcepts}. Then, components of the response function are introduced: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The gas dynamics within the \gls{sts} need to be simulated. See section~\ref{sec:intSpecModelResponseGasDynamics}.
	\item The characteristics of the KATRIN spectrometer can be summarized in the so-called transmission function. See section~\ref{sec:intSpecModelResponseTransmission}.
	\item The passage of electrons through the \gls{wgts} is characterized by scattering from gas molecules. The probability for such scattering is discussed in section~\ref{sec:intSpecModelResponseScattering}. Furthermore, the amount of energy an electron loses when scattering is considered in section~\ref{sec:intSpecModelResponseEloss}.
\end{itemize}
Finally, the described components will be assembled to the KATRIN response function in section~\ref{sec:intSpecModelResponseReconciliation}.
\subsection{Concepts and Nomenclature}
\label{sec:intSpecModelResponseConcepts}
\todo{introduction}

\paragraph{Coordinate System}
This chapter focuses on a one-dimensional description of the KATRIN response function. The position along the beam line is denoted with $z$. The origin of the coordinates system is the center of the \gls{wgts} as already chosen in previous works, e.\,g.~\cite{Groh2015,Kleesiek2014}. In this sense, the start and the end of the \gls{wgts} of length $d$ have the coordinates $\mp d/2$.

\paragraph{Pitch Angle}
Within this chapter the angle between a $\upbeta$ electron's direction of motion and the beam line axis, the so-called pitch angle, is denoted by $\theta$.

\paragraph{Parameter Indices}
Whether a $\upbeta$ electron reaches the KATRIN detector i.\,a.~depends on its parameters when originating in the \gls{wgts}. Within this chapter these starting parameters are denoted with a lower index $\mathrm{S}$. The three decisive starting parameters are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The starting kinetic energy $\Esource$. It is discussed within the description of the differential rate in equation~\eqref{eq:intSpecModelDiffSpec}.	
	\item The starting position $\zSource$ within the \gls{wgts}.
	\item The starting pitch angle $\thetaSource$ within the \gls{wgts}.
\end{enumerate}
Parameters that denote quantities in the analyzing plane (see section~\ref{sec:katrinExpSetupSpectrometer}) are denoted with a lower index $\mathrm{A}$.

\paragraph{Probabilistic Treatment of  the Starting Pitch Angle}
It should be noted, that the three listed starting parameters are not known for a single $\upbeta$ electron, which suggests a probabilistic treatment. Within the scope of this thesis this is of importance with respect to the starting starting pitch angle. Therefore, the concept is explained in the following:

The mean value of any function $g(\thetaSource)$ depending on a fixed starting pitch angle $\thetaSource$ can be extracted within an interval $[0, \thetaMax]$ given the distribution $\omega(\thetaSource)$ by applying the definition of the mean value
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:intSpecModelPitchAngleAveraging}
\mean{g(\thetaSource)} = 
\frac{
	\int_{0}^{\thetaMax} 
	\omega(\thetaSource)
	g(\thetaSource)
	\d \thetaSource   
}{
	\int_{0}^{\thetaMax} 
	\omega(\thetaSource)
	\d \thetaSource 
} \fullstop
\end{equation}

An isotropic $\upbeta$ electron emission by a tritium molecule into the unit sphere, meaning all combinations of spherical emission angles $(\varphi, \vartheta=\thetaSource)$ are equally likely, yields as distribution for their starting pitch angle\cite{Angrik:2005ep}
\begin{equation}
\omega(\thetaSource) = \sin\thetaSource
\end{equation}
with normalization
\begin{equation}
	\int_{0}^{\thetaMax} 
	\omega(\thetaSource)
	\d \thetaSource = 
	\frac{1}{1-\cos\thetaMax}
	\fullstop
\end{equation}
Within this chapter $\thetaMax$ denotes the maximum acceptance angle due to the magnetic bottle effect as explained in section~\ref{sec:katrinExpSetupSpectrometerMACE} with a design value of $\thetaMax\approx\SI{51}{\degree}$ \cite{Angrik:2005ep}.

\paragraph{Experimental Settings}
As the response function models the characteristics of the KATRIN apparatus it naturally depends on the experimental settings. The quantities used within this chapter are listed in the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the magnetic field $\Bsource$ at the place of origin of a $\upbeta$ electron within the \gls{wgts};
	\item the magnetic field $\Bana$ within the analyzing plane;
	\item the maximum magnetic field $\Bmax$ along the beam line axis;
	\item the retarding voltage $U$ and the retarding energy $qU$;
	\item the starting potential $\Usource$ of a $\upbeta$ electron within the \gls{wgts}.
\end{itemize}
For the detailed meaning of these parameters and their KATRIN design values, see section \ref{sec:katrinExpSetupSpectrometer}.
It should be noted, that none of these quantities are constant, but they exhibit a spatial, especially a radial, dependency~\cite{Angrik:2005ep}. For ease of notation, the spatial dependency is left implicit within this chapter.


\subsection{Gas Dynamcis}
\label{sec:intSpecModelResponseGasDynamics}
The gas dynamics within the \gls{sts} have to be simulated. This topic is not treated in detail within this thesis. Instead the reader is referred to~\cite{Hoetzel2012}. In short, in a one-dimensional description the output of such a gas dynamic simulation is the gas molecule density $\rho(z)$. Averaged over all starting positions $z$ and multiplied with the length $d$ of the \gls{wgts}, one obtains the design column density $\rho d = \SI{5e17}{cm^{-2}}$~\cite{Angrik:2005ep}.

\subsection{Transmission Function}
\label{sec:intSpecModelResponseTransmission}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{\currentFigureFolder/transmission.pdf}
	\xcaption{The KATRIN transmission function}{The KATRIN transmission function}{as described by equation \eqref{eq:intSpecModelTransmission}. It denotes the probability for an $\upbeta$ electron with a kinetic energy $E$ to pass through the spectrometer set to a retarding potential of $U$. The probabilistic treatment of the starting pitch angles of $\upbeta$ electrons leads to the \gls{mace}-filter width $\Delta E$. (The transmission function was calculated using the SSC software framework, see section \ref{sec:statMethodsKaFitSSC}.) }
	\label{fig:intSpecModelTransmission}
\end{figure}
The transmission function denotes the probability of a $\upbeta$ electron to pass the \gls{mace} filter. It can be characterized by the so-called transmission energy~\cite{Groh2015}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:intSpecModelTransmissionEnergy}
\Etrans = 
\frac{
	q(U-\Usource)
}{
	1-\sin^2\thetaSource \frac{\Bana}{\Bsource} \frac{\gammaSource+1}{\gammaAna+1}
}
\fullstop
\end{equation}
where $\gammaSource\equiv\gammaSource(\Esource)$ and $\gammaAna$ denote the relativistic $\gamma$-factor of the $\upbeta$ electrons at their place of origin respectively the analyzing plane. As the electrons are slowed down substantially by the retarding potential in the spectrometer, it holds $\gammaAna\approx1$~\cite{Groh2015}. In the following, for ease of notation, also $\Usource=0$ and $\gammaSource=1$ is assumed.

$\upbeta$ electrons pass the \gls{mace} filter if their energy $E$ when arriving at the spectrometer surpasses the transmission energy $\EtransPure$. This condition can be resolved for the starting pitch angle~\cite{Groh2015}
\begin{align}
&E > \Etrans \nonumber \\
\Leftrightarrow \quad
& \thetaSource < \thetaTrans
\coloneqq
\arcsin
\left(\sqrt{
	\frac{E-qU}{E} 
	\frac{\Bana}{\Bsource}
}\right)
\fullstop
\label{eq:intSpecModelTransmissionPitchAngle}
\end{align}
Using equation \eqref{eq:intSpecModelTransmissionPitchAngle}, the transmission function depending on the starting pitch angle and the starting energy of $\upbeta$ electrons can be formulated as a step function
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:intSpecModelTransmissionStep}
\mathcal{T}(E, qU, \thetaSource) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \thetaSource < \thetaTrans \\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
\fullstop
\end{equation}
Calculating the mean value of this step function with respect to the probabilistic distributed starting pitch angles of $\upbeta$ electrons as described in section~ \ref{sec:intSpecModelResponseConcepts} yields the often quoted KATRIN transmission function~\cite{Angrik:2005ep}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:intSpecModelTransmission}
	T(E, qU) = 
	\mean{\mathcal{T}(E, qU, \thetaSource)} =
	\begin{cases}
	0 & \text{ if } E < qU \\
	\frac{
		1-\sqrt{
			1-\frac{E-qU}{E} 
			\frac{\Bsource}{\Bana}
		} 
	}{
		1-\sqrt{1-\frac{\Delta E}{E}\frac{\Bsource}{\Bana}}
	}
	& \text{ if } qU < E < qU + \Delta E \\
	1 & \text{ if } qU + \Delta E < E
	\end{cases}
	\comma
\end{equation}
where $\Delta E=E\cdot\Bana/\Bmax$ is the \gls{mace}-filter width as explained in section~\ref{sec:katrinExpSetupSpectrometer}. The transmission function is depicted in figure~\ref{fig:intSpecModelTransmission} for the KATRIN design values.

\subsection{Probability of Electron Scattering within the \gls{wgts}}
\label{sec:intSpecModelResponseScattering}
This section aims at deriving an expression for the probability $P_l$ of an electron to scatter $l$ times within the \gls{wgts} in a bottom-up approach.

First, an expression for the effective column density $\lambda$ an electron passes through is presented. The electron moves on a spiral track due to its cyclotron motion in the magnetic field in the \gls{wgts}. Therefore, when traveling an infinitesimal distance $\d z$ in $z$-direction, it travels a total distance of
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:intSpecModelInfinitesimalElecPath}
\d s = \frac{1}{\cos\thetaSource} \d z 
\fullstop
\end{equation}
(It is noteworthy, that is expression is independent of the electron energy and the magnetic field strength in the \gls{wgts}.)
The effective column density can then be expressed as a path integral over the gas density~$\rho(z)$ from the starting position of the electron to the point where it leaves the \gls{wgts}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:intSpecModelEffColumnDensity}
\lambda(\zSource,\thetaSource) = 
\int_{\varphi} \rho(\Vec{r})\d s =
\frac{1}{\cos\thetaSource}
\int_{\zSource}^{d/2} \rho(z)\d z
\fullstop
\end{equation}
The expected scattering count then is the product of the effective column density $\lambda(\zSource,\thetaSource)$ and the scattering cross section $\sigma$~\cite{Groh2015}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:intSpecModelExpectedScatteringCount}
\mu(\zSource, \thetaSource) = \lambda(\zSource,\thetaSource) \sigma \fullstop
\end{equation}
The scattering process fulfills the conditions of a Poisson process, namely scattering once does quasi not influence the probability of an electron to scatter again; the expected scattering count $\mu(\zSource, \thetaSource)$ stays constant (under the assumptions made so far); and it is unlikely for two scatterings to happen within a short distance. Thus, the probability for $l$-fold scattering can be expressed as a Poisson distribution~\cite{Groh2015}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:scatProbs}
P_l(\zSource, \thetaSource) = 
\frac{
	\mu(\zSource, \thetaSource)^l
}{l!}
\mathrm{e}^{-\mu(\zSource, \thetaSource)} \fullstop
\end{equation}
The mean value with respect to the starting positions and the starting pitch angles can be calculated~\cite{Groh2015}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:intSpecModelAveragedScatProbs}
	\bar{P}_l =
	\frac{1}{d}
	\int_{-d/2}^{d/2}
		\frac{1}{1-\cos\thetaMax}
		\int_{0}^{\thetaMax}
			\sin\thetaSource
			P_l(\zSource,\thetaSource)
		\d \thetaSource
	\d \zSource
	\fullstop
\end{equation}
Table~\ref{tab:intSpecModelAveragedScatProbs} lists the numerical evaluation of these averaged scattering probabilities.

\begin{table}[ht]

	and a maximum acceptance angle of $\thetaMax=\SI{50.7685}{\degree}$.

\end{table}

\subsection{Energy Loss of Electrons due to Scattering}
\label{sec:intSpecModelResponseEloss}
This section describes the so called ``energy loss function'' $f_l(\epsilon)$. It denotes the probability of an electron to loose an energy $\epsilon$ when scattering $l$ times. Only the case of inelastic scattering is treated here. For an additional treatment of elastic scattering, that is less likely by one order og magnitude, the reader is referred to~\cite{Kleesiek2019}.

A phenomenological description for 1-fold scattering of electrons from hydrogen isotopologues was derived at the Troitsk experiment~\cite{Aseev2000, Abdurashitov2017}
\newcommand{\epsCrit}{\epsilon_\mathrm{c}}
\begin{equation}
	f_1(\epsilon) =
	\begin{cases}
		A_1 
		\euler^{ 
			-2\left(
			\frac{\epsilon-\epsilon_1}{\omega_1}
			\right)^2
		}
		&\text{ if } \epsilon < \epsCrit \\
		A_2\frac{
			\omega_2^2
		}{
			\omega_2^2+4(\epsilon-\epsilon_2)^2
		} 
		&\text{ if } \epsilon \geq \epsCrit
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
with the parameters 
$A_1=0.204\pm0.0001$, 
$A_2=0.204\pm0.0001$, 
$\omega_1=\SI{1.85\pm0.02}{eV}$
$\omega_2=\SI{12.5\pm0.2}{eV}$
$\epsilon_1=\SI{12.6}{eV}$ (fixed)
$\epsilon_2=\SI{14.30\pm0.02}{eV}$
