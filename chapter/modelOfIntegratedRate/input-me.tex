\chapter{Mathematical Model of a KATRIN Measurement}
\label{sec:intSpecModel}
This chapter aims at deriving a mathematical expression for the integrated $\upbeta$-decay rate measured by KATRIN in order to be used in parameter inference.
\todo{Write chapter outline. Here are some useful sentences: In $\upbeta^-$ decay the released energy is distributed among the emitted electron and the anti-electron neutrino. }

This section presents a quantitative expression for the $\upbeta$-decay rate of a tritium molecule in dependence on the kinetic energy of the emitted $\upbeta$ electron (differential rate). Accordingly, the differential rate is depicted in figure~\ref{fig:intSpecModelDiffSpec} for a vanishing and non-vanishing effective electron-antineutrino mass. The following paragraphs describe the differential rate in a top-down approach. In other words, first the whole expression is denoted, then its components are explained.

Using Fermi theory and Fermi's golden rule the decay rate of a tritium molecule is~\cite{Kleesiek2019} 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:intSpecModelDiffSpec}
\diffRate = &
\frac{\fermiConst^2 \abs{V_\mathrm{ud}}^2}{2 \pi^3}
\abs{\nucMatrixElement}^2 \cdot
F(Z, E) \cdot 
p(E+m_\elecIndex) \cdot 
\sum_{f} 
	P_f \cdot 
	\epsilon_f \cdot 
	\sqrt{\epsilon_f^2-\nuMass^2} \cdot 
	\thetaFunc(\epsilon_f-\nuMass)
	\fullstop
\end{align}
Its constituents are the kinetic electron energy $E$;
the effective electron-antineutrino mass $\nuMass$ defined via the PMNS matrix $U$, equation \eqref{eq:PMNSmatrix},
\begin{equation}
	 \nuMass^2 = \abs{U_{\elecIndex i}}^2 m_i^2\,;
\end{equation}
the Fermi constant $\fermiConst$;
the up-down-quark-coupling given by the Cabibo angle $\theta_\mathrm{C}$~\cite{Kleesiek2019}
\begin{equation}
V_\mathrm{ud} = \cos \theta_\mathrm{C} = 
0.97425\pm0.00022;
\end{equation}
and the nuclear transition matrix element~\cite{Kleesiek2019}
\begin{equation}
\abs{\nucMatrixElement}^2 = g_V^2+3g_A^2 \quad
\text{with } g_v = 1 \quad
\text{and} \quad g_A/g_V = -1.2646 \pm 0.0035
\end{equation}
which is independent of the electron's kinetic energy as the decay is super-allowed and given by the vector $g_V$ and axial vector $g_A$ coupling.

Furthermore, the Fermi function $F(Z,E)$ accounts for the Coulomb interaction between the outgoing electron and the daughter nucleus with atomic charge $Z=2$, which in its relativistic version can be approximated as~\cite{Kleesiek2019}
\begin{equation}
F(Z,E) \approx \frac{2 \pi \eta}{1-\exp{2 \pi \eta}} \cdot R
\comma
\end{equation}
with Sommerfeld parameter $\eta = \alpha Z / \beta$, fine structure constant $\alpha$, relativistic velocity $\beta$ and a relativistic correction factor $R = 1.002037-0.001427\beta$~\cite{Kleesiek2019}.

The phase-space factor of the outgoing electron with momentum $p$ and mass $m_\elecIndex$ is given by the factor $p(E+m_\elecIndex)$.

The phase space factor of the emitted neutrino  depends on multiple quantities: First, there is the $\upbeta$-spectrum endpoint $E_0$. $E_0$ is the total nuclear tritium-decay energy $Q$ corrected for the nucleus recoil $E_\mathrm{rec}$ also called endpoint of the $\upbeta$ spectrum
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:intSpecModelEndpoint}
E_0 = Q-E_\mathrm{rec}
\fullstop
\end{equation}
$Q$ is the mass difference of mother and daughter nucleus and was determined in a Penning trap measurement to be $Q=\SI{18592.01\pm0.007}{eV}$~\cite{Myers2015}. Furthermore, there is the final state energy of the molecular system $V_f$. The exited energy state $f$ is caused by vibration, rotation or electronic excitation of the decaying molecule. A review on tritium molecular final states and tabulated values can e.\,g.~be found in~\cite{Bodine2015} and references therein.  The probability that the molecular system is in a final state of energy $V_f$ after the decay is denoted by $P_f$. Then the energy of the neutrino reads 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_f = E_0 - E - V_f 
\fullstop
\end{equation}
The neutrino's momentum is $\sqrt{\epsilon_f^2-\nuMass^2}$. And the complete phase space factor of the neutrino is a sum over all possible molecular final states labeled $f$.

Lastly, the Heavyside step function $\thetaFunc$ ensures a positive kinetic energy of the neutrino.
