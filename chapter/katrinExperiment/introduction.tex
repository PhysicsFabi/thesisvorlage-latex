The KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment performs a kinematic measurement of the tritium-$\upbeta$ spectrum in order to determine the effective mass of the electron antineutrino (from here forth labeled $m_\upnu$) as defined by equation (\ref{eq:nuMassSquared}). In case no neutrino mass signal is observed, KATRIN aims to set an upper limit of
\begin{equation*}
m_\upnu < \SI{200}{meV} \quad (\SI{90}{\percent} \text{ C.L.})
\comma
\end{equation*}
which is one order of magnitude lower than the one set by its predecessor experiments.
KATRIN recorded the first $\upbeta$ spectrum in March 2018 and started neutrino mass measurements in March 2019.

This chapter provides an overview of the KATRIN experiment: Section~\ref{sec:katrinExpSetup} lists KATRIN's hardware components and their purpose. Section~\ref{sec:katrinExpIntSpecModel} derives a mathematical model of a KATRIN neutrino mass measurement. And section~\ref{sec:katrinExpNuMassMeasurement} presents how such a measurement appears in practice.
