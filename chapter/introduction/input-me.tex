\chapter{Introduction}
To our current knowledge, neutrinos are at the same time the most elusive and most abundant massive particles in the Universe. Their detection is challenging and pushes experiments to the edge of technical frontiers. Yet, their understanding might shed light on long-standing open questions of modern physics: What is dark matter? Do Majorana particles exist? Why does matter predominate over antimatter? What happened in the earliest stages of our Universe just after the Big Bang? And in all these regards, the yet unknown mass of neutrinos is a key physics parameter.

The KArlsruhe TRItium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment aims to measure the effective mass of the electron antineutrino with an unprecedented sensitivity of \mbox{\SI{200}{meV} (\SI{90}{\percent} C.L.)} by precision spectroscopy of the endpoint region of the tritium-$\upbeta$-decay spectrum. This sensitivity is one order of magnitude more constraining than the one of the predecessor experiments.

In order to provide this sensitivity, KATRIN features i.\,a.~a gaseous tritium source. Its special characteristics must be well controlled and understood. This thesis focuses on two selected models concerning electron-scattering in said gaseous source: 
\begin{dingautolist}{172}
	\item\label{itm:introductionEDepCrossSec} The dependence of the cross section for inelastic electron-scattering off hydrogen isotoplogues on the energy of the incident electrons should be investigated. Former works primarily used a constant cross section when simulating KATRIN neutrino mass measurements. An energy-dependent scattering model should be established and applied within simulated neutrino mass inference.
	\item\label{itm:introductionKatrinEloss} In a commissioning measurement that was conducted in fall 2018, the KATRIN collaboration has established a preliminary model of the probability density for the energy an electron loses when scattering in the KATRIN gaseous tritium source. The aim of this thesis was the implementation of statistical methods that enable the general treatment of model uncertainties. The methods were then tested in the context of the preliminary energy loss model in order to assess systematic effects in neutrino mass inference.

The results are listed in the summary in chapter~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\paragraph{Outline}
This thesis is structured as follows:

Chapter \ref{sec:neutrinoPhysics} is a brief introduction to neutrino physics with special emphasis on the measurement of the neutrino mass.

Chapter \ref{sec:katrinExpSetup} focuses on the experimental setup of the KATRIN experiment.

Chapter \ref{sec:intSpecModel} introduces a mathematical model of a KATRIN neutrino mass measurement that can be used in parameter inference.

Chapter \ref{sec:statMethods} integrates the mathematical model into a statistical framework for neutrino mass inference.

Chapter \ref{sec:eDepScatCrossSec} investigates a refinement of the mathematical model by incorporating the energy-dependence of the cross section for inelastic electron scattering in the KATRIN gaseous tritium source as per item~\ref{itm:introductionEDepCrossSec}.

Chapter \ref{sec:katrinEloss} focuses on the treatment of uncertainties from a preliminary model for the energy loss of electrons scattering inelastically off deuterium molecules as per item~\ref{itm:introductionKatrinEloss}.

And chapter \ref{sec:conclusion} summarizes the results.
