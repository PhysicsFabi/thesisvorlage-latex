\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I am convinced that there is always something new to learn. Nonetheless, handing in this work is the final act within my official education. It has been a long journey. 

I would like to express my gratitude to the people who helped me in completing this thesis:

First, I would like to thank Prof.~Dr.~Guido Drexlin for being a reviewer of this thesis and giving me the opportunity to work at the KATRIN experiment.

Special thanks goes to Dr.~Kathrin Valerius as the leader of the Young Investigator Group that I enjoyed being part of over the course of my thesis. Thank you for the warm welcome, that you enabled my stay the MIT, and that you always made time, when I needed to discuss something. And, of course, thank you, for being a the reviewer of this thesis. 

I would also like to thank my adviser Moritz Machatschek. Thank you for your enthusiasm when tackling my physics problems as if they were your own. Also, thank you for frequently cross-checking my ideas, hinting me towards errors and offering solutions. Especially, thank you for your easygoing and calm attitude. It was a great experience having you as an adviser.

I would also like to thank Dr.~Valérian Sibille. Thank you for advising me before, during and after my stay at the MIT. And thank you for enabling my stay in the first place. I also greatly appreciate the enormous amount of time you took for reviewing my program code and teaching me software engineering as well as physics - and (maybe unintentionally) food culture. I also found it very considerate of you to check back on me on a regular basis.

I would also like to thank Dr.~Won-Qook Choi. Thank you for being such a cheerful and kind person. And thank you for frequently giving me the opportunity to express my opinion in software matters and appreciating my ideas. Also, thank you for helping me with analysis problems, with the analysis software and for the many discussions.


I would also like to thank Dr.~Hendrik Seitz-Moskaliuk. Thank you for having been a pleasant office mate and for always promptly addressing my questions. Also, thank you for being the first to proofread pages of my thesis. Your feedback doubtlessly influenced my further writing style.

I would also like to thank Dr.~Jan Behrens. Thank you for proofreading a chapter of my thesis and for helping me many times with the computer infrastructure.


Also, I would like to thank the rest of the Young Investigator Group and the people at KATRIN that helped me on a daily basis - be it practically or motivational: 
Dr.~Carsten Röttele, 
Emma Malcherek, 
Fabian Block, Dr.~Ferenc Glück, Dr.~Florian Fränkle, Dr.~Florian Heizmann,
Dr.~Joachim Wolf,

and the ones I forgot. 


In a broader scope, I would like to thank my friends and family for always supporting me during my education. Especially, I want to mention my parents and my sisters. Thank you.
